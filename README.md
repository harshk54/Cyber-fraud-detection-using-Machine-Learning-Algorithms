# Cyber-fraud-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In this project, I've implemented Cyber Fraud Detection System using 10 different Machine Learning Algorihtms on the same datset. <br/>
In order to see this project you just have to download this whole repository in your system and then simply you can open the index.html file to view the HTML Report.
<br/>In order to have better insights of the project I've also shared the cyber_fraud dataset on which I've applied different ML models.
<br/><br/>
Happy Learning!
